# CodeClause_project_movie_analysis
Movie Analysis Using Python
In this project, a different approach will be proposed, trying to explain the evaluation of a given production not only by the viewers' opinions, but also by the parameters of the film. The project will focus mainly on exploratory data analysis, The data for the project uses a pre-built database of films from the Kaggle portal, which, however, has been extended with additional information by using Python.
